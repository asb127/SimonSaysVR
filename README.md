# SimonSaysVR
Simon Says game made in Unreal Engine 4 for VR

## How-to-play
Interact with the white button to start the game.

In the game, the player has to match a colour sequence. The colour buttons must be pressed in the correct order the right amount of times to complete the round.

For every round completed, the game adds a new colour to the sequence. The whole sequence will be repeated then to the player.

Try to last as long as possible!
